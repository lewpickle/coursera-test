        We serve the best fried chicken in town, covered in mixed herbs and spices, 
        and our signature deep fry batter. Our fried chicken comes with sides such as
        cajun fries, truffle fries, green salad or coleslaw. The choice is up to you!

        <div id="dish">Steaks</div>
        We use 100% fresh Australian beef for our steaks and you get to curate your own experience of how you want your beef cooked:
        Rare, Medium Rare, Medium Well, or Well Done. These steaks also come with a choice of sides 
        such as a bowl of green salad, scrambled eggs, french fries or a bowl of warm, hearty mushroom soup.
        There are various condiments for the steaks that you can choose from to garnish and complement the beef's unique taste.

        <div id="dish">Sushi</div>
        We use real Japanese rice and premium quality ingredients imported from Japan to recreate a fusion of the Japanese and American Cuisine. 
        With the classic Japanese nori and rice, we complement it with a touch of seafood and meat to provide you the best sushi eating experience.
         Our sushi sets come with a hot or cold cup of matcha and a bowl of edamame beans.
